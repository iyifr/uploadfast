Uploadfast allows you to build file uploads into your web application.
File Uploads for *all* of us.


### The missing marketing section
So let's say you're a developer trying to build a website or mobile app that allows users to upload images and other types of content. 
e.g e-commerce website, e-commerce marketplaces, social media app, airchat


I often have to build these sites for freelance work or side projects.. 
I don't look forward to implementing file uploads.
Every project has different requirements, 
I often find myself just needing the URL to the file so i can access over the internet and then serve it to my user on the frontend.

But this can get tedious.
- Building UI components, 
- Reading the uploaded files from the native interface (to show previews, calculate size..), 
- Working with an image cropper... and worst of all

*Having to read and re-read API docs*

Obviously **THIS SUCKS**, so i built uploadfastðŸ˜„

```typescript
Type Token = {
    id: string;
    building: boolean
}

const code = 'Iyimide is creating something special for the world'
const arr = ["Iyimide", "Adekile"]
```
