Uploadfast is a simple file-upload - as - a - service that helps developers who are shipping fast, ship file uploads in record time.

### The missing marketing section
Implementing file uploads in your web application can be such a drag.
It could be an e-commerce site where the admin has to upload images of their products. 

It could be an image sharing app or a file compression tool.
You could even be building airchat.

I often run into file uploads on the projects I work on, I wondered why I have to do so much just get the URL of the asset I want to serve to my user. 
All i need is link please, don't stress me too much.


File uploads can get very tedious.
- Building UI components from scratch and styling them properly,
- Reading the picked files from the native interface (i.e if you want to show a preview)
- Working with an image cropper... and worst of all

*Having to read and re-read API docs*

**THIS SUCKS**.


So i built uploadfastðŸ˜„

Get that url to the user uploaded asset and serve!

```typescript
Type Token = {
    id: string;
    building: boolean
}

const code = 'Iyimide is creating something special for the world'
const arr = ["Iyimide", "Adekile"]
```
